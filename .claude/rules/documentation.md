# Documentation Standards

**CRITICAL:** Documentation must be updated whenever features are added, changed, or removed. Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation.

---

## The Golden Rules

1. **ALWAYS update CHANGELOG.md for every change**
2. **ALWAYS update relevant user guides for user-facing changes**
3. **ALWAYS update technical docs for architecture changes**
4. **NEVER leave TODO comments without tracking in DEVELOPMENT.md**
5. **ALWAYS keep documentation in sync with code**

## Documentation Quality Standards

### Writing Style

✅ **DO:**
- Use clear, concise language
- Write in active voice
- Use present tense for features ("The system validates...")
- Include code examples where helpful
- Link to related documentation
- Use proper markdown formatting

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use jargon without explanation
- Write vague descriptions ("improves performance")
- Leave broken links
- Include outdated screenshots
- Use passive voice excessively
- Assume prior knowledge

### Code Examples

Always include:
- Working, tested code
- Necessary imports
- Context (what file, what scenario)
- Expected output or behavior

```python
# ✅ GOOD EXAMPLE
# In app/routes/student.py

from app.models import Student, StudentBlock

# Get students for current class period
students = Student.query.join(StudentBlock).filter(
    StudentBlock.join_code == current_join_code
).all()

# Returns: List of Student objects scoped to join_code
```

```python
# ❌ BAD EXAMPLE
# Get students
students = query_students()
```

### Markdown Formatting

Use proper markdown:

```markdown
# H1 - Document Title (once per document)
## H2 - Major Sections
### H3 - Subsections
#### H4 - Minor Subsections

**Bold** for emphasis
*Italic* for references
`code` for inline code
```code blocks``` for multi-line code

- Unordered lists
1. Ordered lists

> Blockquotes for important notes

## Common Documentation Mistakes

### ❌ MISTAKE 1: Not updating CHANGELOG.md

**Problem:** Users can't track what changed between versions

**Solution:** Update CHANGELOG.md in EVERY PR

### ❌ MISTAKE 2: Outdated code examples

**Problem:** Documentation shows code that no longer works

**Solution:** Test all code examples before committing docs

### ❌ MISTAKE 3: Broken links

**Problem:** Links to moved/renamed files return 404

**Solution:** Check all links when reorganizing docs

### ❌ MISTAKE 4: Vague descriptions

**Bad:**
```markdown
### Changed
- Improved performance
- Fixed bugs
- Updated UI
```

**Good:**
```markdown
### Changed
- Reduced payroll calculation time by 40% using cached queries (#XXX)

### Fixed
- Auto-tap-out bug where missing join_code prevented token accumulation (#607)

### Changed
- Updated student dashboard with modern card-based layout (#XXX)
```

### ❌ MISTAKE 5: Missing upgrade instructions

**Problem:** Breaking changes without migration guide

**Solution:** Always include upgrade steps for breaking changes

---

## Documentation Tools

### Link Checker

Before committing:

```bash
# Check for broken internal links
grep -r "](/" docs/
grep -r "\[.*\](.*\.md)" .
```

### Markdown Linter

Use a markdown linter:

```bash
# Install markdownlint
npm install -g markdownlint-cli

# Run linter
markdownlint docs/**/*.md
```

---

## Review Checklist

Before marking docs as complete:

- [ ] All facts accurate
- [ ] All links work
- [ ] All code examples tested
- [ ] Proper markdown formatting
- [ ] No spelling errors
- [ ] Consistent terminology
- [ ] Clear and concise
- [ ] Appropriate detail level
- [ ] Cross-references where needed
- [ ] Updated file dates
