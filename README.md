# 🎓 Classroom Token Hub

An interactive banking and classroom management platform for teaching students about money while tracking classroom participation.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL database
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd classroom-economy
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   SECRET_KEY=<long-random-string>
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
   FLASK_ENV=development
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-byte-base64-key>  # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
   PEPPER_KEY=<secret-pepper-string>
   CSRF_SECRET_KEY=<random-string>

   # Cloudflare Turnstile (CAPTCHA) - Optional for development/testing
   # Leave unset to bypass Turnstile verification in testing environments
   TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=<your-turnstile-site-key>
   TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=<your-turnstile-secret-key>

   # Optional maintenance mode banner (503 page)
   MAINTENANCE_MODE=false
   MAINTENANCE_MESSAGE="We're applying updates."
   MAINTENANCE_EXPECTED_END="Back online by <time>"
   MAINTENANCE_CONTACT="ops@example.com"
   ```

   **Getting Turnstile Keys (Optional):**

   Turnstile keys are optional for development and testing. If not configured, CAPTCHA verification will be automatically bypassed.

   For production deployment:
   1. Visit [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/turnstile)
   2. Create a new site widget
   3. Copy the Site Key and Secret Key

   For testing with CAPTCHA enabled, you can use Turnstile's test keys (always pass):
   - Site Key: `1x00000000000000000000AA`
   - Secret Key: `1x0000000000000000000000000000000AA`

4. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

5. **Create your first system admin**
   ```bash
   flask create-sysadmin
   ```
   Follow the prompts and scan the QR code with your authenticator app.

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

### Testing with Sample Data

- Use `student_upload_template.csv` as a reference for CSV roster uploads
- Run `python seed_dummy_students.py` to seed the database with sample students

flask db downgrade                 # Rollback
```

### Common Commands

```bash
flask run                     # Run development server
flask create-sysadmin         # Create system admin

## Roadmap

Active priorities are tracked in [docs/development/TODO.md](docs/development/TODO.md). Current focus areas include:

- Multi-teacher hardening (teacher ownership enforcement, tenancy audit, runbook)
- Coverage for shared-student payroll and attendance flows
- Operational safety for future migrations and maintenance windows

---

## Monitoring

Deploy behind a production web server (e.g., NGINX). The `/health` endpoint returns a 200 status when the database is reachable.

```bash
curl http://your-domain/health
```
