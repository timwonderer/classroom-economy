      <h3>Quick Summary</h3>
      <p><strong>What this means:</strong> By using Classroom Token Hub, you agree to use the app responsibly for educational purposes. Keep your login information safe, be respectful to others, and follow your school's rules. The app is provided as-is for educational use, and we can't be held responsible if something goes wrong. We may need to suspend accounts that violate these terms.</p>
      <p><strong>For students:</strong> Your teacher chose this app for your class. If you have questions, talk to your teacher.</p>
      <p><strong>For teachers:</strong> This app is free for educational use but cannot be used for commercial purposes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Accepting These Terms</h2>
    <p>When you create an account and use Classroom Token Hub (the "Service"), you're agreeing to follow these Terms of Service. If you don't agree with these terms, please don't use the app.</p>

    <h2>2. What Is Classroom Token Hub?</h2>
    <p>Classroom Token Hub is an educational web application designed to help students learn about financial literacy through a simulated classroom economy. Teachers can use it to manage virtual currency, track student participation, and create engaging lessons about money management.</p>

    <h2>3. Your Account Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>We worked hard to design this app so it can give you the best experience while protecting your privacy. Anyone working behind the scene to maintain this app do not have access to any information about you.</p>
      <p>To use the app, you'll need to create an account with a username, PIN, and passphrase. These three pieces of information are what's keeping your account safe from anyone who is not supposed to use your account. </p>
        <p>You can protect yourself by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keep your credentials private</strong>: Don't share your username, PIN, or passphrase with anyone.</li>
      <li><strong>You're responsible for your account</strong>: Any activity on your account is your responsibility, so keep your login information secure.</li>
      <li><strong>Report security issues immediately</strong>: If someone else accesses your account or you notice suspicious activity, let your teacher know right away.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How to Use the App Responsibly</h2>
    <p>We trust you to use Classroom Token Hub appropriately. Please don't:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Break any laws or school rules while using the app</li>
      <li>Pretend to be someone else or lie about who you are</li>
      <li>Try to hack, disrupt, or interfere with the app or other users' accounts</li>
      <li>Attempt to access parts of the system you're not supposed to see</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Even though the people working on this app can't see your personal information, they can still block your account from accessing the app if they believe your actions are harmful for everyone else.</p>

    <h2>5. Ownership and How You Can Use It</h2>

    <h2>6. Account Suspension or Termination</h2>
    <p>We hope it never comes to this, but we may need to suspend or terminate accounts that:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Are used inappropriately or to harm others</li>
      <li>Pose security or safety concerns</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If this happens, we may do so immediately to protect other users and the integrity of the app.</p>

    <h2>7. No Warranties (The App Is Provided "As Is")</h2>
    <p>We work hard to make Classroom Token Hub reliable and useful, but like all software, it's not perfect. The app is provided "as is" and "as available," which means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We don't guarantee the app will always work perfectly or be available 24/7</li>
      <li>We can't promise it will meet all of your specific needs</li>
      <li>You use the app at your own risk</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We'll do our best to fix issues and keep things running smoothly, but we can't make any absolute guarantees.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the extent permitted by law, Timothy Chang and anyone involved in creating or maintaining Classroom Token Hub cannot be held responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lost data, profits, or opportunities</li>
      <li>Indirect or unintended consequences from using (or not being able to use) the app</li>
      <li>Issues caused by factors outside our control</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This app is a free educational tool, and while we work to make it great, we can't be liable for every possible issue that might arise.</p>

    <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the service is operated. Any disputes will be handled according to those laws.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may need to update these terms from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll notify users at least 30 days before the new terms take effect. By continuing to use the app after changes are made, you're agreeing to the updated terms.</p>

    <h2>11. Questions or Concerns?</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms of Service, please file an in-app supprt ticket.</p>
