## Account Setup

Before you can log in, you need to set up your account.

### Step 1: Claim Your Account

Your teacher will provide you with a **join code** for your class period.

When you're ready, go to the "Claim Account" page and enter:

1.  The join code from your teacher.
2.  The **first initial of your first name**.
3.  Your **last name**.
4.  Your **birthday sum** (month + day + year as numbers, e.g., March 2, 2012 → 3 + 2 + 2012 = **2017**).

These details match what your teacher entered. If anything doesn't work, double-check the spelling of your name and the birthday sum math.

### Step 2: Create Your Username

Next, you will be given a prompt to help you create a unique username. Follow the instructions on the screen to generate your username.

### Step 3: Set Your PIN and Passphrase

Finally, you will create a **PIN** and a **passphrase**.

-   **PIN:** A short number you will use to log in and for quick actions like starting work and taking breaks.
-   **Passphrase:** A longer, more secure password that you will use for important actions like buying items from the store.

**Important:** Memorize your PIN and passphrase. Do not share them with anyone!

## Logging In

Once your account is set up, you can log in with your username and PIN at the student login page.

## Your Dashboard

The dashboard is your main page where you can see all your account information.

### Tapping In and Out

At the beginning of each class period, use the "Start Work" button on your dashboard to start tracking your time. When you are finished for the day or taking a break, click "Break / Done". Your earnings are calculated based on the time you are working.

### Checking Your Balances

Your dashboard shows your **checking** and **savings** account balances.

-   **Checking:** Use this account for everyday transactions like buying items from the store.
-   **Savings:** Use this account to save money and earn interest.

### Viewing Transactions

The "Transactions" section on your dashboard shows a history of all your financial activity, including payroll, bonuses, and purchases.

## Features

### Transferring Money

You can transfer money between your checking and savings accounts using the "Transfer" feature.

### The Store

Visit the "Shop" to buy items with the money you've earned.

### Rent

If your teacher has enabled the rent system, you can view your rent status and pay your rent from the "Rent" page.

### Insurance
