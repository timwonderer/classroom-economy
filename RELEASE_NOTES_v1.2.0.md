**Release Date**: December 24, 2025

Version 1.2.0 focuses on delivering a refined mobile experience while cleaning up several lingering layout issues. Students now get a purpose-built mobile dashboard and store, while admins benefit from streamlined settings screens and an insurance editor that no longer overflows on smaller devices.
